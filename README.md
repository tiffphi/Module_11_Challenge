Module 11 Assignment - WebScraping 

I ran into a few issues during this assignment. I couldnt figure out how to scrape the header and row data for Part 2, so I used different code to do so. I also had some challenges with the graphs in being able to organize them so that they ascended visually by the bars rather than the x-axis.
